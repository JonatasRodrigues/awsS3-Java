# awsS3-Java

In this project, I will show you how to create and list a bucket, create folder into a bucket, upload file and delete all these items. You
will need to create an user in Amazon IAM and get a "Access Key" and "Secret Access Key" to connect to S3. It's necessary add
"AWSConnector" and "AmazonS3FullAccess" permissions in IAM to your user.
